# `actions/checkout` can leak Github Credentials

> Based on the article, [actions/checkout can leak GitHub credentials](https://yossarian.net/til/post/actions-checkout-can-leak-github-credentials/), from [William Woodruff](https://github.com/woodruffw)

This extra ball just wants to demonstrate what William perfectly explained in his article: that by default, `actions/checkout` can silently leak Github credentials to the runner.

If you copy the following block of code into the `pipeline-scan.yml`, replacing the `jobs` section, you will see that the `actions/checkout` action will leak the Github credentials to the runner.

```yaml
jobs:
  checkout-leak:
    name: "actions/checkout can leak GitHub credentials"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read # As we're going to expose this file, let's limit the permissions

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Show `.git/config` content
        run: |
          cat .git/config
```

Not that easy, trying just this won't work because the value will be masked:

But, if we add this step to upload the `.git/config` file as artifact:

```yaml
      - name: Upload .git/config
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@ea165f8d65b6e75b540449e92b4886f43607fa02 # v4.6.2
        if: always()
        with:
          name: git-config
          path: .git/config
          retention-days: 1
```

We can download and see the credentials:

```bash
$ cat .git/config

[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true
[remote "origin"]
	url = https://github.com/unicrons/github-actions-playground
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[gc]
	auto = 0
[http "https://github.com/"]
	extraheader = AUTHORIZATION: basic <the Github token as base64>
```

And we can test it works by running the following command:

```bash
$ curl -H "Authorization: basic $(echo $GH_TOKEN | base64)" \
       "https://api.github.com/repos/unicrons/github-actions-playground"
{
  "id": 1004909337,
  "node_id": "R_kgDOO-WzGQ",
  "name": "github-actions-playground",
  "full_name": "unicrons/github-actions-playground",
  "private": false,
  [...]
```

> ![NOTE]
> I did not find a way to use the Github Actions Token to enumerate informations without knowing previously the name of the repository or the organization.
