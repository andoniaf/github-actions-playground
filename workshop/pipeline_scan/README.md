# Pipeline Security Scan

This workshop module focuses on scanning the pipeline configuration itself for security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

## What is Pipeline Security Scanning?

Pipeline security scanning analyzes your CI/CD workflows, configurations, and automation scripts to identify security risks in your deployment process. This is crucial because compromised pipelines can lead to supply chain attacks.

## Common Pipeline Security Issues

1. **Secrets in Workflows** - API keys, passwords, or tokens hardcoded in YAML files
2. **Excessive Permissions** - Workflows with unnecessary write permissions
3. **Untrusted Actions** - Using third-party actions without proper verification
4. **Insecure Triggers** - Workflows triggered by external events without validation
5. **Missing Security Controls** - No approval processes for sensitive operations

## Tools Used in This Module

- **GitHub Security Tab** - Built-in secret scanning
- **actionlint** - GitHub Actions workflow linter
- **semgrep** - Static analysis for CI/CD configurations
- **Custom Scripts** - Organization-specific policy checks

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand pipeline security risks
- Learn to identify insecure workflow configurations
- Know how to implement pipeline security best practices
- Understand the importance of least privilege in automation

## Workshop Exercise

1. Review the workflow files for security issues
2. Identify hardcoded secrets and excessive permissions
3. Learn to use automated pipeline scanning tools
4. Implement security fixes and best practices

## Security Checklist

- [ ] No secrets in workflow files
- [ ] Minimal required permissions
- [ ] Pinned action versions
- [ ] Secure triggers and conditions
