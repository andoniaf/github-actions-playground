# Perfect Pipeline Workshop

Welcome to the "Perfect Pipeline" workshop! This hands-on workshop teaches you how to build a comprehensive security-focused CI/CD pipeline with multiple layers of security scanning and best practices.

## 🎯 Workshop Objectives

Learn to implement a complete secure software development lifecycle with:
- Pipeline security scanning
- Static and dynamic code analysis
- Secrets detection and management
- Container security scanning
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security
- Runtime security testing

## 🏗️ Workshop Structure

The workshop is organized into progressive modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of pipeline security:

## 📚 Workshop Modules

### 1. 🔍 [Pipeline Security Scan](workshop/pipeline_scan/)
Learn to scan CI/CD pipelines for security misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.

### 2. 🔬 [Code Security Analysis](workshop/code_scan/)
Implement SAST (Static Application Security Testing) and SCA (Software Composition Analysis).

### 3. 🔐 [Secrets Detection](workshop/secrets_scan/)
Detect and prevent exposure of credentials and sensitive information.

### 4. 🐳 [Container Security Scanning](workshop/container_scan/)
Scan Docker images and containers for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

### 5. 🏗️ [Infrastructure Security Scan](workshop/iac_scan/)
Analyze Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) for security issues.

### 6. 🔍 [Runtime Security Testing](workshop/runtime_scan/)
Perform dynamic security testing and runtime monitoring.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account with Actions enabled
- Basic knowledge of CI/CD concepts
- Understanding of Docker and containers
- Familiarity with cloud infrastructure concepts

### Workshop Flow
1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Follow each module** in the workshop directory
3. **Run the workflows** and observe the security findings
4. **Learn to fix** the identified vulnerabilities
5. **Implement security best practices**

## 🔧 Sample Application

The workshop includes a intentionally vulnerable Node.js application with:
- Hardcoded secrets and credentials
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Authentication bypasses
- Insecure file uploads
- Missing input validation
- Information disclosure

## 🏗️ Infrastructure

The Terraform configuration includes common misconfigurations:
- Overly permissive security groups
- Unencrypted resources
- Exposed sensitive outputs
- Missing security controls
- Hardcoded credentials

## 📊 Security Scanning Results

Each workflow will demonstrate realistic security findings:
- **High/Critical vulnerabilities** in dependencies
- **Hardcoded secrets** in code and configuration
- **Container vulnerabilities** in base images
- **Infrastructure misconfigurations** in Terraform
- **Runtime vulnerabilities** in the running application

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

By completing this workshop, you will:
- Understand the importance of shift-left security
- Know how to implement comprehensive security scanning
- Learn to interpret and triage security findings
- Understand security best practices for CI/CD
- Be able to build secure, automated pipelines

## 🛠️ Tools Demonstrated

The workshop showcases various security tools:
- **GitHub Security Features** (Dependabot, Secret Scanning)
- **SAST Tools** (Semgrep, CodeQL, SonarQube)
- **SCA Tools** (npm audit, Snyk, OWASP Dependency Check)
- **Container Scanners** (Trivy, Grype, Docker Bench)
- **IaC Scanners** (Checkov, TFSec, Terrascan)
- **DAST Tools** (OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite)

## 🔄 Workshop Progression

1. **Start with vulnerable code** - See realistic security issues
2. **Run security scans** - Understand what tools detect
3. **Analyze findings** - Learn to prioritize and triage
4. **Implement fixes** - Apply security best practices
5. **Verify improvements** - Confirm issues are resolved

## 📈 Success Metrics

Track your progress through:
- Reduced number of security findings
- Faster detection of security issues
- Improved security posture scores
- Better understanding of security practices
